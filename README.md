    this idea have roots in the latest 1993 , i mean c just born in 1972,
    so ... i have a lot to understand before 2024.
</p>

<p>
     if that make sence to you welcome, if not maybe you are younger,
     by the way i just trying to point to the fact that if you are 
     a younger person i mean from the 1994 you will probably take,
     one or two tricks of this but , be aware that you have to make 
     it work for you .... yeah i came from that era where everyone was
     diferent and that was te thing at leats for me.
</p>

<p>
    so why you should even read this , yeah you got it,
    don't over think about that , it is the magic of 93,
    you just know. probably you hear or saw before this
    a similar version but beleve me , the rainbow stuff 
    wasn't a public thing yet.  
</p>

<p>
 what i mean ... i was wrong , about how persons behavior 
 shoul be about specific topics but bro ... i was who i am at that time
 so i am not going to tall about that , i am going to show you
 with code in php hate it as f* too , but in that time who cares i am just for a year before.
</p>

<p>

    clear on that , well hopefully i can make something 
    that maybe will be a referance to the old school but
    also little cool to the new ones.
